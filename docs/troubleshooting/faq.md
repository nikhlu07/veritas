Common questions and answers about Veritas.

## General Questions

### What is Veritas?
Veritas is a blockchain-powered platform that allows businesses to make verifiable sustainability and quality claims about their products. Consumers can instantly verify these claims by scanning QR codes.

### How does blockchain verification work?
When a business submits product claims, they're permanently recorded on the Hedera blockchain. This creates an immutable timestamp that proves when the claim was made and ensures it can't be altered later.

### Why use Hedera instead of Ethereum or Bitcoin?
Hedera offers several advantages:
- **Speed**: 3-5 second finality vs 15+ minutes
- **Cost**: $0.0001 per transaction vs $10-50
- **Sustainability**: Carbon negative vs high energy consumption
- **Enterprise Ready**: Built for business use cases

## For Businesses

Veritas uses a simple pricing model:
- **Submission**: $0.0001 per product claim (blockchain fee)

### What types of claims can I verify?
