## 🎯 Demo Talking Points

### Opening Hook
> "What you're about to see isn't a simulation or mockup. Every transaction, every QR code, and every verification you'll witness represents real data recorded on the Hedera blockchain network."

### Product Claims Verification
> "Traditional product claims rely on trust. With Veritas, every claim is mathematically verifiable through blockchain cryptography. You can't fake a Hedera transaction."

### Real-Time Network Status
> "Notice the green indicator showing 'Hedera Testnet Online.' This demo is connected to a live blockchain network processing real transactions as we speak."

### HashScan Proof
> "When I click this HashScan link, you'll see the actual Hedera network explorer showing our transaction with timestamp, fees, and immutable proof of submission."

### Business Value
> "For businesses: Build customer trust with verifiable claims. For consumers: Instantly verify any product authenticity with a simple scan."

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **HashScan Links**: If external links don't work, explain they lead to real Hedera explorer
2. **Network Delays**: If verification is slow, mention real blockchain consensus time (~3 seconds)
3. **Mobile QR Scanning**: Ensure good lighting and steady hands for QR code scanning

### Backup Scenarios
- If live submission fails, use pre-created demo products
- Keep batch IDs written down for manual verification
- Have HashScan URLs bookmarked for quick access
